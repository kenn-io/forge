# UI Interaction Contracts

Use this document for frontend behavior changes where the risk is not visual
style but stale identity, broken persistence, or surprising interaction
semantics.

## Purpose

- Make behavior-level UI contracts explicit.
- Keep route identity, persisted browser state, and keyboard/pointer semantics
  consistent across the app.
- Prevent narrow regressions that usually show up only after review or in e2e
  flows.

## Identity And Route State

Interactive surfaces must agree on which item is selected.

- Treat `platform_host` as part of PR and issue identity in route state, drawer
  state, and stale-detail guards.
- When host is omitted for the default GitHub host, normalize comparisons so
  `github.com` and an omitted host do not look like different items.
- Use shared named route/item reference types from
  `frontend/src/lib/stores/router.svelte.ts` instead of repeating anonymous
  `{ owner, name, number }`-style shapes.
- When a view changes from item A to item B, reset transient action state that
  could otherwise submit or render against the wrong item.

Responsive layout changes must not change route identity.

- Resizing a canonical PR or issue route must not rewrite `/pulls/...`,
  `/pulls/.../files`, `/issues/...`, or `/host/{platform_host}/...` into
  `/focus/...` or `/m/...`.
- Responsive presentation decisions belong in the shell/rendering layer. Route
  builders still follow the active route family: canonical builders for
  canonical routes, focus builders for explicit `/focus` routes, and mobile
  builders for explicit `/m` flows.
- If a canonical list route renders with the focus presentation because the
  viewport is compact, selecting an item should still navigate to a canonical
  detail route.
- Distinguish compact desktop presentation from phone-like presentation in
  state names and tests. Compact desktop may hide sidebars or use the focus
  presentation; phone-like contexts may additionally use mobile typography,
  touch hit targets, and phone-specific action layouts.

Examples of transient state that should usually reset on identity change:

- inline edit drafts
- merge/close/reopen dialogs
- approve/review forms
- embedded detail-tab selection when the parent surface owns the item

## Persistence Scope

Persisted controls must state their scope clearly.

- Browser-local preferences belong in `localStorage` only when the behavior is
  intentionally per-browser and not worth server settings.
- URL query state belongs in the route only when deep-linking or back/forward
  navigation is part of the feature contract.
- Server-backed settings belong in the API only when the preference should
  follow the user/config rather than one browser session.

Whenever a control persists, document and test:

- where it persists
- whether it is global, per-view, or per-item
- what happens after navigating away and back

## Nested Interaction Rules

Rows that contain buttons, links, or toggles need clear event ownership.

- Activating a nested control inside a clickable row must not also trigger the
  row's navigation or selection behavior.
- Escape should close drawers, split-detail panels, menus, or modals when that
  surface is currently active.
- Focus-visible states matter for controls that are visually subtle, such as tab
  close buttons or compact action affordances.
- If a component claims menu-like behavior, it must honor the keyboard and focus
  contract of that role. Otherwise, use simpler semantics honestly.

## Filtering And Visibility Rules

Not every visibility control means "remove this entity entirely."

- Controls that toggle detail visibility should preserve the parent row unless
  the feature explicitly removes that category from the result set.
- When two data sources race, prefer the source that matches the user's current
  filter/scope rather than a stale but faster preview.
- Empty states should make it clear when filters, not missing data, are hiding
  results.

## Threaded Comments

Threaded comment rendering must preserve both timeline recency and reply
context.

- In reverse-chronological timelines, a thread is positioned where its newest
  visible event would have appeared.
- Inside that thread, render the main/root comment first, then threaded replies
  underneath in reverse-chronological order: newest reply, then the reply before
  that, and so on.
- Do not flatten same-`thread_id` comments into separate top-level timeline
  items when the surrounding UI is meant to show comment conversations.
- This contract should also guide future diff-comment UI: inline diff threads
  can anchor to a file/line position, but their compact timeline summaries
  should still use root-comment context plus newest-first replies.

## Optional Metadata Controls

Optional metadata must not reserve empty rows or placeholders when absent. Put
compact edit controls beside the metadata's normal display location, and keep
empty states for places where missing data itself is useful information.

Async detail mutations must be scoped to the currently visible item. Compare the
full provider route identity before opening transient UI or applying mutation
responses, and discard stale responses instead of patching another item.

## Testing Expectations

Behavior contracts should usually be tested where the user would notice the
breakage.

- Component tests for local state transitions, event propagation, and route/item
  identity helpers.
- Store tests for persistence scope and normalization logic.
- Playwright/e2e tests for navigation away/back, Escape behavior, nested button
  activation, and other multi-surface flows.
